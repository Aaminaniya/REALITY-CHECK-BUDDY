### Project Description
Reality Check Buddy is a friendly web-based companion that provides comforting, supportive, and reality-based responses to common emotional thoughts. It helps users process feelings like sadness, anxiety, and self-doubt with encouraging messages.
### The Problem statement
Ever feel overwhelmed by your own thoughts? Like, "Why does everyone hate me?" or "I'm such a failure." These thoughts can spiral and feel very real, even when they're not. We're solving the problem of "overthinking overload."

### The Solution
Reality Check Buddy is like that one friend who always knows what to say. You select your current thought, hit a button, and BAM‚Äîyou get a reality check that‚Äôs honest, kind, and sometimes even funny. It‚Äôs like mental first aid, but with emojis. üòä
